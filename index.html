          <h1>Learn Python in a Week</h1>
          <p>Set up the mind first
            Prepare your mind first and start at the right time. You can learn any programming language in a week time, but it requires strong willing and a focused week.
            
            Motivation
            I am not an engineer, why should I learn Python? The reality is that Python is becoming the new Excel.
            
            Many investment banks and financial institutions now require the analysts, traders and portfolio managers to have working knowledge of Python. There is the trend of data driven approach outside financial industry too. So, ability to work with Python is now an advantage for your career for sure.
            
            Set up right goal
            We are not engineers and we have our own professions. We only need to code when it helps solving the day-to-day tasks. Most of our daily tasks are not performance critical (let’s be honest). So, our goal should be good enough coding a functional program to solve our daily tasks.
            
            Install Anaconda
            We are not engineers. You don’t need to research the technology stack of Python to learn it. Just download and install Anaconda. That is good enough and easy enough to start Python.</p>

          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.</p>

          <h2>Applications</h2>
          <p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p>
